# Preprint Review Metadata

A shared data model and documentation for preprint review metadata, aiming to establish common standards and protocols for consistent metadata representation across platforms.

## Overview

This repository provides a standardised approach to preprint review metadata, including:
- Common data models and schemas
- Recommended metadata elements and their definitions
- Implementation guidelines for different platforms
- Examples and best practices

## Purpose

The goals of this project are to:
- Reduce barriers to adopting common metadata standards
- Increase visibility and consistency of preprint reviews
- Support better recognition and reward for reviewers
- Enable interoperability between different platforms and systems

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organised in `/docs` as follows:
- A page for each essential metadata element
    - Real world deposit and retrieval examples using Crossref, Datacite and DocMaps
    - Community actions and discussion on implementing the metadata

## Getting Started

### Local Development

To run the documentation site locally:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
bundle install
```

2. Start the Jekyll server:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

3. View the site at `http://localhost:4000`

## Comments and Discussion

This documentation uses [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) for comments and discussions. Giscus is a comments system powered by GitHub Discussions, which means:

- Comments are stored in your repository's Discussions
- Users need a GitHub account to comment
- Comments are moderated through GitHub's interface
- Discussions are searchable and can be referenced in issues

Each documentation page has a comments section at the bottom where you can:
- Ask questions about the content
- Share implementation experiences
- Suggest improvements or clarifications
- Discuss metadata standards and practices
